Install http-server globally using npm to allow you to run a web server from your computer.

Open cmd and enter the follow:
  ```npm install -g http-server```
  
___Start a web server___

Go to the directory of your project with cmd-prompt
  ```cd documents/github/project-example``` 
Once you're in the directy you can easily start the server by writing the following:
  ```http-server```
You should see something like the following:
  ``` 
  C:\documents/github/project-example>http-server
      Starting up http-server, serving ./
      Available on:
        http://192.168.0.5:8080
        http://127.0.0.1:8080
      Hit CTRL-C to stop the server 
  ```
